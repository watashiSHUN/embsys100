1, there's other ways that we can represent negative numbers (use a sign bit)
however, in that case we will end up with two representation of zeros, +0 and -0
2, having two zero also means that we get one less representation for the same
bit length that is [-2^31+1,2^31-1] vs [-2^31, 2^31-1]
3, makes arithmetics simple, A - B == A + (-B) or in other words, no special logics
is required for positive number + negative number
