autonomous vechile:

they have a lot of inputs, radar and sensors
interrupt needs to be responded very quickly
if we detect a pedastrian, we want the break
to kick in as soon as possible

system needs to be robust, we are not fault tolerant
when people's live are on the line, ie kernal cannot die
we can't allow a blue screen of death
